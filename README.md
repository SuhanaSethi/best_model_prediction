<h2>Best Model Predicted- Bayesian Ridge</h2>

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this analysis is **Fuel_cell_performance_data-Full.csv**.
- The target variable for this model is **Target2**.
- The dataset includes multiple columns, and other target columns (`Target1`, `Target3`, `Target4`, `Target5`) were dropped for the analysis.
  
### Data Preprocessing:
- **Target columns** other than `Target2` were removed.
- The data was split into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** sets.
- **Normalization** and **transformation** techniques were applied to scale the features and enhance model performance.

## Performance

The Bayesian model performed well with the following metrics:

- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: 0.6632
